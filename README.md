## Introduction to Bayesian Methods

[Bayesian methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics#:~:text=Bayesian%20statistics%20(%2FËˆbe%C9%AA,of%20belief%20in%20an%20event.) provide a powerful framework for statistical modeling and inference, distinguishing themselves from classical machine learning approaches through their unique treatment of uncertainty. Unlike traditional models that typically rely on point estimates, Bayesian methods estiemate probability distributions and incorporate **prior beliefs** about parameters, allowing for the integration of previous knowledge or assumptions into the modeling process. This prior information can help [regularize problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)), especially in cases where data is sparse or noisy, leading to more robust and interpretable models.

In Bayesian analysis, inference is achieved by updating these prior beliefs with observed data to form a **posterior distribution**. This process leverages [Bayes' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem), which mathematically describes how to update probabilities given new evidence.

### Sampling Methods

To compute posterior distributions, Bayesian methods often rely on sampling techniques. One of the most common methods is [**Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo) sampling, which generates samples from a probability distribution by constructing a Markov chain that converges to the desired distribution. While MCMC is a powerful approach, it can be time-consuming, particularly for complex models or large datasets.

An alternative to MCMC is [**Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_Bayesian_methods), which provides a faster way to approximate posterior distributions. SVI utilizes optimization techniques to minimize a loss function that represents the divergence between the true posterior and a simpler variational distribution. This method is particularly useful for large-scale data and models, enabling efficient inference in Bayesian frameworks.

## Covered Topics in This Repository ðŸ“š

This repository covers a range of topics within Bayesian machine learning, providing detailed implementations and examples for each. The topics include:

- [**Bayesian Linear Regression**](./Bayesian%20Linear%20Regression): An extension of linear regression that incorporates uncertainty in the model parameters, allowing for probabilistic interpretations of predictions.
  
- [**Bayesian Logistic Regression**](./Bayesian%20Logistic%20Regression*): A probabilistic approach to classification that models the relationship between a binary outcome and predictors, incorporating prior distributions for parameters.
  
- **Volatility Analysis with LÃ©vy Stable Distribution**: An exploration of financial data modeling, focusing on the characterization of volatility through stable distributions, which can capture heavy tails and skewness in financial returns.

Each topic is presented with clear explanations, code implementations, and insights into the Bayesian approach.
